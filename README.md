# 📊 Project: Data Analysis with R  

This project showcases my ability to work with data using R. It highlights my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and commitment to continuous learning. While the project is fully functional, I also use it as a foundation for deepening my understanding of R and exploring best practices in data analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project  
1. To demonstrate my technical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using R.  
2. To apply a hands-on approach to learning by working with data and delivering actionable insights.  
3. To challenge myself to build scalable and meaningful solutions as I grow in my data analytics journey.

## 🔑 Key Features  
- Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy and consistency through effective preprocessing techniques.  
- Visualization: Created clear, insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.  
- Geospatial Analysis: Incorporated tools like Tableau to analyze geographical patterns and anomalies.  
- Reproducibility: Organized the code and documented each step for clarity and ease of reuse.  

---

## 🔍 My Approach  
- The project reflects my own analytical process, including the logic, insights, and conclusions.  
- While I consulted external resources for code syntax and tool guidance (e.g., ChatGPT, documentation, Stack Overflow), all decisions, analysis, and problem-solving were my own.  
- I treated this project as both a learning experience and a demonstration of my skills, ensuring that it aligns with real-world scenarios.

## ⚠️ Limitations and Challenges  
1. Trip Duration Policy  
   - Impact: There is no information on the maximum allowed trip duration, making it unclear whether long trips represent normal usage or system misuse.  
   - Solution: Understanding this policy would help optimize membership recommendations.   
2. Financial Data  
   - Impact: The dataset lacks financial metrics, making it difficult to assess which user group generates more revenue.  
   - Solution: Incorporating average revenue per trip/user could refine membership conversion strategies.   
3. Geographical Boundaries & Anomalies  
   - Impact: Some trips start in Lake Michigan or beyond Chicago’s boundaries. Without precise boundary data, fully cleaning these anomalies is challenging.  
   - Solution: Validating trip locations against known station coordinates could eliminate outliers.

## 🔮 What’s Next?  
1. Optimization: Exploring ways to make the code more efficient and scalable.  
2. Integration: Incorporating additional tools like SQL or Power BI to create a more comprehensive pipeline.
